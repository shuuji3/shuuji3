Hi! 🙂 I enjoy working on open-source contributions in my spare time aside from my full-time software engineer job (at [Navagis](https://navagis.com/)). I mainly speak JavaScript/TypeScript and Python and I love the Web where everyone with Internet access can access the shared knowledge and that can everyone's lives better.

Recent highlighted contributions include [nimble Mastodon client elk](https://github.com/elk-zone/elk) 🦌 and the [Japanese translation of Vite documentation](https://github.com/vitejs/docs-ja/) ⚡. Also, I occasionally create Issues and PRs for various open-source projects.

You can find [all my contributions on GitHub here](https://github.com/search?q=author%3Ashuuji3+archived%3Afalse+&ref=advsearch&query=sort%3Aupdated-desc+user%3A%40shuuji3+archived%3Afalse+%28type%3Apr+OR+type%3Aissue%29&type=pullrequests)

If you're a Japanese speaker 🇯🇵, you may have already read my translations on some websites and applications. I've translated English into Japanese on open source projects on GitHub, or in the popular localization platforms for open source software such as Transifex ([@shuuji3](https://www.transifex.com/user/profile/shuuji3/)) and Crowdin ([@shuuji3](https://crowdin.com/profile/shuuji3)), otherwise on Wikipedia articles (tech and non-tech articles, [all contributions here](https://ja.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?target=TAKAHASHI+Shuuji&namespace=0&tagfilter=&newOnly=1&hideMinor=1&start=&end=&limit=500&title=%E7%89%B9%E5%88%A5%3A%E6%8A%95%E7%A8%BF%E8%A8%98%E9%8C%B2)).
